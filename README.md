# Securing-DevOps-Pipelines-Best-Practices-with-Cosign-Distroless-Images-and-PSPs
Due to their portability and scalability, container-based architectures have become increasingly prominent in the world of software development. However, it is crucial to make sure that container deployments are secure. In this blog article, we will examine two potent techniques that can improve the security of containerized applications: Cosign and Distroless images. We will also go through what PSPs are and how it may be applied to the pod security.

## Using Cosign to Secure Containers:
Cosign is an open-source application that enables users to sign and validate container images, hence enhancing deployment security. You may make sure that only reputable pictures are distributed in your environment by signing container images with Cosign.

First, you need to install Cosign on your system using the following command:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/cosign/main/install.sh | sudo
```
Once Cosign is installed, you can sign your container images using the command:
```
cosign sign -key cosign.key <image>
```
This command generates a signature for the image, which is saved as an annotation in the image manifest. To verify the signature of a container image, you can use the command:
```
cosign verify <image>
```
This verification process compares the signature to the signer’s public key, ensuring that the image has not been tampered with.

## Enhancing Security with Distroless Images:
Distritoless images are container images with no extraneous system-level components, just the programme and its runtime dependencies. Distroless images give another degree of security by minimising the attack surface. Here is an illustration of a Dockerfile for a Python Flask application using a Distroless image:
```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian10

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

CMD [ "python3", "app.py" ]
```
In this example, the base image used is gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian10. The necessary dependencies are installed using pip3, and the application code is copied into the image. By only including the runtime dependencies, you can significantly reduce the attack surface of your containerized applications.

## Using Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSPs):
It’s critical to secure the pods running in a Kubernetes cluster in addition to the container images. A method for defining security policies for pods running in a Kubernetes cluster is provided by Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSPs). You must establish a PSP object with a set of rules outlining the allowed security characteristics in order to use PSPs. A YAML file or the kubectl command-line utility can be used to define PSPs. For instance, privileged, seLinux, and runAsUser rules can be added to a PSP.

When implementing Kubernetes Pod Security Policies, consider the following best practices:

### Start with a PSP that is restricted:
Start with a tight PSP and gradually release the constraints in accordance with the demands of your application. You can increase the security of your pods using this method.

### Apply PSPs to certain namespaces:
Apply PSPs to particular namespaces to impose various security policies on various Kubernetes cluster components. This gives you flexibility in how you may manage security across your infrastructure.

### Using RBAC, manage PSP access:
To control who can create or change PSPs, use role-based access control (RBAC). By doing this, you can prevent unauthorised users from altering your security policies.

### Utilise the PSP Admission Controller:
When adding pods in your cluster, enable the PSP Admission Controller to automatically validate and enforce PSPs. This guarantees that security regulations are consistently applied throughout all pods.

## Significance of Container Security
Securing containers with tools like Cosign and Distroless images offers several benefits:

### Defending against supply chain attacks:
Attackers may target container images to compromise their integrity during generation, distribution, or deployment. You can make sure that only reliable pictures are delivered in your environment by using Cosign to sign and validate container images.

### Reducing attack surface:
Distroless pictures get rid of extraneous parts, which makes it harder for attackers to get in. You can lessen your containerized apps’ vulnerabilities by removing unnecessary system-level components.

### Compliance requirements:
Compliance standards may call for the use of signed and certified container pictures, depending on the sector of the economy you work in. These practises will guarantee that you adhere to these requirements.

### Increasing security posture:
You may increase the security posture of your organisation and reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents by securing your container images with Cosign and Distroless images.

## Conclusion
To safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of your applications, containers must be secured. You may increase the security of your containerized applications by utilising solutions like Cosign for container image signing and verification and implementing Distroless images to minimise attack surfaces. You may further fortify your infrastructure by defining security criteria for pods running in a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Pod Security Policies. By putting these security measures into place and adhering to best practises, you may reduce the risk of supply chain threats, meet industry requirements, and improve the overall security posture of your business.
